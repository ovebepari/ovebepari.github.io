I grew up as a silent, observant kid with mild cold-induced breathing difficulty. I navigated poverty, education, society in a non-proactive manner. It allocated me even more time to analyze most events in enormous details. I am almost done with my undergrads now, after years of noticing my own biases and questioning my own stances and beliefs, this is how I veiw the world now.

<small>This is my honest personal view now and it is bound to change. I intend to update the changes with timestamps. Also, I am pessimist by nature so bear with me.</small>

### Unity vs Division
It is impossible to unite us all. It is also impossible to teach ourselves to respect other groups. I do agree education is the only solution and we have to push as far as we can to ensure mutual respect.

### Good vs Bad
Good isn't impactful enough. Good works at night, like a poor mother, when everyone is asleep. 

### Individual vs Groups 
People act differently in groups and their social values (good or bad) take over. Humans as individuals are full of biases and are fundamentally flawed. It is pretty tough to live with one, no matter how good / easy to live with one is.
