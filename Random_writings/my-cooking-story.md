Cooking is fairly simple these days. The willingness to cook regularly is what we struggle with. And no one's cooking journey is interesting enough to read -- you decide to learn it, you put effort and watch some videos, you experiment and fail, and after a few days, voila, you can cook. My cooking story is the same too except maybe how I view cooking and the influences I have had along the way are worth writing about. 

I never liked cooking much. It wasn't intellectually challenging and there was no novelty, same process on repeat, every goddamn day. But, Kamrul Islam, a friend, a football and uni-mate from Sylhet, changed my perspective on cooking forever!
 
Kamrul helped me when I started to conserve more in my sophomore days. My family was struggling to provide me with 4k bdt per month, as always, so I started to cut expenses. In that process, he started to share his dorm room and bed with me, which he got six months earlier than us through his premium network. He loved the kitchen our dormitory offered!

He'd often cook, but it was his process that made me realize he wasn't just some ordinary guy cooking as a random activity of the day. He knew how many tablespoons of ghee and garlic mix were required for a beef recipe for 10 people, and which ingredients to experiment with. He would chop his veggies slowly. He'd stir his makings with utmost care. He'd taste the salt of his recipe like a lovely grandmother. He'd serve us as if we were in a five-star restaurant. He'd enjoy every little compliment of his work like someone who just cooked for the first time for their family!

Living with him, gradually, I started cooking too. A big Sylheti influence in my cooking first up. We were together for six months until I had my own dorm access. We'd become roommates again in the final year, along with another cook, Khandokar Sabbir, a sportsman from Kushtia, a guy who'd cook with the lowest of resources, with a completely opposite cooking style of Kamrul. Kamrul, me and Sabbir would announce our dorm room as a restaurant to our neighbours where every day would feel like a new festival with new recipes, pithas and whatnot. People would come and sponsor and we'd just cook, we'd become freelance cooks at some point. I soon would live the best six months of my life, food-wise.
