Cooking is fairly simple these days. The willingness to cook regularly is what we struggle with. And no one's cooking journey is interesting enough to read -- you decide to learn it, you put effort and watch some videos, you experiment and fail, and after a few days, voila, you can cook. My cooking story is the same too except maybe how I view cooking and the influences I have had along the way are worth writing about. 

I never liked cooking much. It wasn't intellectually challenging and there was no novelty, same process on repeat, every goddamn day. But, Kamrul Islam, a friend, a football and uni-mate from Sylhet, changed my perspective on cooking forever!
 
Kamrul helped me when I started to conserve more in my sophomore days. My family was struggling to provide me with 4k bdt per month, as always, so I started to cut expenses. In that process, he started to share his dorm room and bed with me, which he got six months earlier than us through his premium network. He loved the kitchen our dormitory offered!

He'd often cook, but it was his process that made me realize he wasn't just some ordinary guy cooking as a random activity of the day. He knew how many tablespoons of ghee and garlic mix were required for a beef recipe for 10 people, and which ingredients to experiment with. He would chop his veggies slowly. He'd stir his makings with utmost care. He'd taste the salt of his recipe like a lovely grandmother. He'd serve us as if we were in a five-star restaurant. He'd enjoy every little compliment of his work like someone who just cooked for the first time for their family!

Living with him, gradually, I started cooking too. A big Sylheti influence in my cooking first up. We were together for six months until I had my own dorm access. We'd become roommates again in the final year, along with another cook, Khandokar Sabbir, a sportsman from Kushtia, a guy who'd cook with the lowest of resources, with an opposite cooking style of Kamrul. Kamrul, me and Sabbir would announce our dorm room as a restaurant to our neighbours where every day would feel like a new festival with new recipes, pithas and whatnot. People would come and sponsor and we'd just cook, we'd become freelance cooks at some point. I soon would live the best six months of my life, food-wise.

Life got eventful when I left Kamrul's dorm space. I got my dorm room and soon covid started to spread everywhere and the lockdown started. I lived the first half of the lockdown in my village, playing football with kids, enjoying homemade food, bonding with the people, and sharing Facebook stories of the simplest of things life offered. And I lived the second half of the lockdown in Bhawal National Park, in Creative Conservation Alliance's turtle conservation facility where I volunteered. I lived there for almost all of 2021 with Fahim bhai and Komol da. The facility was ten minute's walk away from the highway and we all enjoyed our solitude, away from the hustle-bustle of the city.

Fahim bhai was the facility manager. He was a did it all-seen it all kinda person and the ex-president of the BracU photography club back in the day. He had every possible life experience, and finally settled in the jungle, doing his bit to 'heal the world'. He had the poster of "Into the Wild (2007)" as his Facebook cover and it showed his views a little. Having all kinds of experiences, he did cook, for sure! He cooked his best recipe for the guests into the facility. He slowly danced if he was in the mood while cooking, from Chaiyaa Chaiyaa to Uptown funk, and the recipes always came out very very hot and spicy! His makings featured various spices, edible fragrances, some of which I didn't know. Guests always asked "who cooked?", praised, and rightly so! He intentionally took a little while to cook and it always paid off. I remember I collected fallen mangoes after the storm once and he made pickles, as nice as any other grandma would make.

Komol da, on the other hand, was a very quick cook, a generalist from Moulovibajar, Sylhet, who worked as an animal keeper at CCA. A peaceful person, always busy, keeping the facility together with his hard work, work ranging from cooking, building, repairing, electrical engineering and whatnot, a real-life Ruplal, the skills necessary to survive in the jungle, he had it all. He could finish twenty other chores while cooking breakfast.
