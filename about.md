I enjoy anything that stirs intellectual interest. I spend a lot of time on the internet. Learning abstraction layers in CS, one abstraction layer a year. I like System Programming, enjoy other people's design choices (UI, UX, Typography, Architecture, Tech Stack etc). Poetry and Sports will save us all one day!

Do not ask your children to strive
- by William Martin 


Do not ask your children 
to strive for extraordinary lives. 
Such striving may seem admirable,
but it is the way of foolishness. 
Help them instead to find the wonder 
and the marvel of an ordianry life. 
Show them the joy of tasting tomatoes, apples and pears. 
Show them how to cry 
when pets and people die. 
Show them the infinite pleasure 
in the touch of a hand. 
And make the ordinary come alive for them. 
The extraordinary will take care of itself.
