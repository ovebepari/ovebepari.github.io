I started web dev back in 2016, when I was a college kid. I started with raw PHP, MySQL hosted on the same machine, hitting databases everytime a user made a request to the website, no caching, no load balancing (we didn't know these things). Our online ticket selling website hit the market but it was bound to fall. And it did. I'm still a student, doing BS in CS, Learning core CS things, Networking, Processes, File Systems, IPC and more.

I didn't commit full time on backend afterwards but I kept myself updated. I explored web frameworks on Python, Node.js. But I started enjoying core CS stuff more, meanwhile keeping an open eye to <a href="/personal/oves-news-knowledge-sources/">my news and knowledge sources, like Hacker News</a>. I kept noticing the docker and microservices bloom and was eager to explore more but was too busy with academic works.

Docker turned out to be phenomenal. And I decided I will work on a niche where I could be closer to a *nix systems (servers? DevOps?) while, a bit of backend now and then. This video below stired my interest on System/Software architechture too, but I guess I need to be a dev first to gain the surface level experience and it might take years to be a software architect.

But it won't stop me from exploring right? It won't. So much more things to learn! So many abstractions to uncover! Let's see.
