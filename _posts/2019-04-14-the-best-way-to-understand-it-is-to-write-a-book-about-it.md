Update: doing my undergrad thesis on filesystemsn now!

Whenever something appears confusing, I interpret it as I'm about to learn this "thing", thus its kinda making sense and kinda not. Well I know a few verses of a poem, maybe not a poem:

> Shall I tell you my friend, how you will come to understand it?
> Go and write a book upon it.
>
> <cite> -- Henry Home, Lord Kames</cite> 

I've been finding my curiosity in Computer **File Systems** lately and I know somewhat something about it. Thus decided to document it titled as **File Systems for Teen Computer Scientists** and I hope I can finish writing this book in time which I'll publish freely.
